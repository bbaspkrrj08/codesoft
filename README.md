Machine Learning Projects
This repository contains multiple machine learning projects implemented in Jupyter Notebooks. Each project focuses on a real-world classification problem using different datasets and techniques.

🚀 Projects Included
1️⃣ Customer Churn Prediction
Goal: Predict whether a customer will churn (leave a service).

Techniques: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).

Applications: Telecom, Banking, Subscription-based businesses.

2️⃣ Credit Card Fraud Detection
Goal: Detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

Techniques: Handling imbalanced datasets (SMOTE, undersampling), anomaly detection, Random Forest, XGBoost.

Applications: Banking, E-commerce payment fraud prevention.

3️⃣ SMS Spam Detection
Goal: Classify SMS messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam).

Techniques: Natural Language Processing (NLP), TF-IDF vectorization, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression.

Applications: Spam filtering in messaging apps, email services.
